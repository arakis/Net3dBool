Net3dBool
=========

This is a port of the java j3dbool library to C#.

Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG) is a modeling technique that uses Boolean operations like union and intersection to combine 3D solids. This library implements CSG operations on meshes. All edge cases involving overlapping coplanar polygons in both solids are correctly handled.
